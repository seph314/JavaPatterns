# inspectvehicle

### School project - Ispect Vehicle
This project is a practise in createing an Java application with the MVC pattern architecture. The comlete program uses the terminal for output, but I have also created the first part of a graphical interface with JavaFX.

Remember to include the: [iv1350-inspect-vehicle-ext-systs.jar](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/andpet52/inspectvehicle/blob/master/iv1350-inspect-vehicle-ext-systs.jar) to be able to access external classes needed like CreditCard, GarageDoor et.c.
